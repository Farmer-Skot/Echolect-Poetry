## **GLOSSARY**

**Echolect:** The form itself; a polyglot phonaesthetic poem. Used as both singular and plural.  
**Tokenette:** The individual phonetic-semantic unit of an echolect poem. A real word from a real language, selected for its dual contribution of sound and meaning.  
**Seed phrase:** The chosen set of words representing the core theme, which constrains all tokenette selection.  
**Ghost-English:** The English-language narrative a listener perceives when an echolect poem is spoken aloud, produced by phonetic coincidence across language families.  
**Vibe story:** The emotional and thematic narrative carried by the aggregate etymological meanings of the tokenettes.  
**Semantic undertow:** The hidden meaning-layer produced by the literal dictionary definitions of constituent tokenettes.  
**Token map:** The analytical document accompanying each echolect poem, specifying the source language, meaning, and phonetic contribution of every tokenette.
