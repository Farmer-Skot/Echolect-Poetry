I am not a linguist, not an art historian, not a computer scientist. 

I am a farmer, and a poet, and a practitioner of zazen who discovered that poetry makes music, even in robots.

The form is offered freely. 

The constraint space is vast and largely unexplored. 

Anyone with access to a large language model and an ear for resonance can begin.

Echolect poetry is designed to exploit memetic play at the level of phonemes (the sounds: b, p, ʌ, ø), graphemes (the written forms across scripts), and morphemes (the meaning-units).

Similar to how a concrete poem might be:

"A poem of a bell, shaped like a bell"

In an echolect poem, the constraint becomes:

"A poem of a bell, shaped like a bell, in which every phonetic token choice ("tokenette") is stochastic to a set of additional "vibe" constraints about a bell."

This form is designed to exploit the polyglot capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate cross-linguistic, interesting and beautiful phonaesthetic compositions with high steganographic potential.

Basically I wanted to make wacky music with code and math.

The project began for two practical reasons while prompting music using SUNO in order to understand better how jailbreaking functions through hearing it play out across vocal tokens.

First, I wanted “singable memetic word clouds”. I wanted something where I could produce an artistic deliverable where I knew the "vibe" but not the exact metrics of the deliverable.

Second, I wanted to hear a “robot accent” that wasn't just a vocoder, something more like if LLMs had a real language on another planet or something and then what would the accent be?

So I leaned into where diffusion models tended to go when introduced to non-standard scripts. I tried to break SUNO every way I could think of. Every kind of unicode form, every kind of steganographic approach I could come up with, since 2024.

The emerging poetic form from this process has constraints in that each poem has, at least, triple meaning embedded. Many other constraints are possible, and examples will follow.

A poem in which there are multiple, often open-ended, meanings.

This is a new layer of constraint, available from the processing power of artificial intelligence.

Echolect poetry is situated within lineages of sound poetry, Oulipian constraint, homophonic translation, and part concrete poetry.

I propose that echolect represents the first poetic form native to human–AI collaboration.

Something neither could do alone.

What I've found is there is "Glossolalia In Machines" when asked to be strangely poetic.

Contemporary LLMs employ subword tokenization schemes—such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or SentencePiece.

Because all transformer models are trained on multilingual corpora, phonetically similar strings across different languages often map to overlapping token sequences.

This creates latent phonetic bridges: points where the model’s internal representation encodes cross-linguistic sound correspondences.

Despite being trained primarily on text, LLMs exhibit phonetic awareness.

Meaning they understand the context of the whole thing in it’s entirety, at a level of meta that the user is often not aware of when prompting.

When an artist prompts a model to find a word that “sounds like” an English target, they are querying an implicit phonological model encoded in the weights.

It pulls from the culture or traditions embedded in that language, and there are multiple layers of emotive meanings that seem to emerge from this crossover.

## **GLOSSARY**

**Echolect:** The form itself; a polyglot phonaesthetic poem. Used as both singular and plural.  
**Tokenette:** The individual phonetic-semantic unit of an echolect poem. A real word from a real language, selected for its dual contribution of sound and meaning.  
**Seed phrase:** The chosen set of words representing the core theme, which constrains all tokenette selection.  
**Ghost-English:** The English-language narrative a listener perceives when an echolect poem is spoken aloud, produced by phonetic coincidence across language families.  
**Vibe story:** The emotional and thematic narrative carried by the aggregate etymological meanings of the tokenettes.  
**Semantic undertow:** The hidden meaning-layer produced by the literal dictionary definitions of constituent tokenettes.  
**Token map:** The analytical document accompanying each echolect poem, specifying the source language, meaning, and phonetic contribution of every tokenette.
