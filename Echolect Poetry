This article introduces **echolect**, a novel constrained poetic form that exploits the polyglot capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate cross-linguistic phonaesthetic compositions with high steganographic potential.

The project began for two practical reasons.

1. I wanted “singable memetic word clouds”  
2. I wanted a “robot accent” that leaned into where diffusion models tended to go.

This poetic form has constraints in that each poem has, at least, triple meaning embedded. Many other constraints are possible, and examples will follow.

A poem in which there are multiple, often open-ended, meanings.

There is at least three levels of embedded meaning in an Echolect poem  
Similar to a concrete poem in which: "A poem of a bell, shaped like a bell". 

However, in an echolect poem it becomes:

"A poem of a bell, shaped like a bell, in which every phonetic token choice ("tokenette") is memetically related to a set of constraints about a bell."

Echolect poetry is situated within lineages of *sound poetry*, *Oulipian constraint*, *homophonic translation*, and *concrete poetry.*

I propose that echolect represents the first poetic form native to human–AI collaboration. Something neither could do alone.

## **The Tower of Babel in Your Pocket**

You carry instant access to every recorded human language in your pocket. Every phonetic pattern, every etymological echo, every morpheme that any culture ever pressed into sound.

In the process of simple observation, a discovery arose when trying to create a “robot accent” from pushing the SUNO music into areas they weren’t trained to go.  

I noticed certain prompting strategies produced text with unusual properties, when asking the model to find words across multiple languages. What emerged sounded like the target English phrase while conversing meaning related to a separate concept. 

Both visually, and musically, the results were startling.

The poems that emerged were polyglot tapestries that, when spoken aloud, produced an uncanny “ghost-English”. An audible narrative that seemed to arise from nowhere, carried entirely by phonetic coincidence across language families.

They came with a strange dialectic accent, and conserved meaning across generations when re-prompted with the echolect poem across other AI models. I named this form echolect, from the Greek ἠχώ (echo, reflection) and λέγειν (to speak, to gather). Language echoing itself across the model’s vast linguistic memory.

And here I would like to give it to you.

## **Toward a Definition**

**Echolect** /ˈɛkoʊˌlɛkt/ n. (neol. 2024): A polyglot compositional mode exploiting the simultaneous multilingual capacity of large language models to generate cross-linguistic phonaesthetic resonance. These are phonetic kinships manufactured in real-time from probability space rather than discovered in etymology.

Three properties define an echolect poem:

1. **Lexical Integrity:** Each constituent element, or *tokenette*, is a real word from a real language, carrying dictionary meaning.  
2. **Dual Constraint:** Tokenettes are selected for their phonaesthetic proximity to a target sound (ghost-English) and/or their etymological resonance with a thematic seed.  
3. **Tripartite Operation:** The artifact operates differently across three modes:  
   * **Visual:** A multi-script texture for the human eye.  
   * **Auditory:** A phonetic narrative (ghost-English) for the human ear.  
   * **Computational:** A dense thematic signal for the LLM's attention mechanism.

## **Poetic Lineage and Departure**

Echolect stands in relationship to established traditions but departs from them through the affordances of AI.

#### **Sound Poetry and Zaum**

The Russian Futurists coined *zaum* (заумь, “beyond-sense”) around 1913, seeking a transrational language operating through pure phonemic force. 

While echolect shares this emphasis on phonemic texture, *zaum* often invents phonemes from scratch. Echolect, conversely, harvests existing linguistic data. It discovers the transrational already latent in the overlaps between existing tongues.

#### **Oulipian Constraint**

The Ouvroir de littérature potentielle (Oulipo) produced literature under strict formal constraints. Echolect is Oulipian in spirit, but where typical constraints operate within a single language, echolect’s constraint operates across the global linguistic corpus simultaneously. This feat is practically impossible for a human practitioner without computational assistance.

#### **Homophonic Translation**

Louis Zukofsky’s *Catullus* translated Latin into English words chosen for sonic resemblance rather than semantic fidelity: “Odi et amo” became “O th’hate I move love” or David Melnick’s *Men in Aïda* performed the same operation on Homer’s Greek. This is probably echolect’s closest ancestor. But the direction is inverted: where homophonic translation takes a foreign source text as input and produces English-sounding output, echolect takes English as its target and outputs polyglot text. The arrow of translation is reversed.

#### **Concrete Poetry**

Established by Eugen Gomringer and others, concrete poetry asserts that visual arrangement constitutes meaning. Echolect extends this by using mixed scripts (e.g., Devanagari, Hanzi, Cyrillic) not as decoration, but as a structural representation of the model’s multilingual training.designed to be seen by a human reader, parsed by an LLM, read in one way, spoken in another, heard a third way, and throughout, encoding a thematic story accessible only through a token map of some kind.

## **What No Poem Could Do Before**

A human polyglot could, theoretically, construct an echolect poem. But the simultaneous access to phonetic patterns across dozens of language families is computationally native to an LLM in a way it never was to any human practitioner. The ability to search for “what real word sounds like *X* and means *Y*” across all human tongues at once for a four-word English phrase, searching across fifty languages with ten thousand common words each yields 10¹⁶ possible combinations, something possible with advanced self-attention.

The LLM exploits the geometric structure of its embedding space, where phonetically similar tokens cluster regardless of source language. The search becomes a form of nearest-neighbor retrieval in high-dimensional vector space rather than exhaustive enumeration. What took Schwitters decades to produce in a single language, a practitioner with an LLM can explore across all languages in seconds.

This makes echolect arguably the first poetic form that is native to human–AI collaboration. The human brings intention, aesthetic judgment, the ear for resonance, the willingness to follow a strange sound into strange meaning and subjective beauty choosing. The machine brings simultaneous access to the full phonetic inventory of recorded human language and emergent and surprising linguistic connections.

## **Technical Foundation**

The computational feasibility of echolect depends on specific properties of modern transformer-based language models.

#### **Tokenization and Latent Bridges**

Contemporary LLMs employ subword tokenization schemes—such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or SentencePiece. 

Because all transformer models are trained on multilingual corpora, phonetically similar strings across different languages often map to overlapping token sequences. This creates **latent phonetic bridges**: points where the model’s internal representation encodes cross-linguistic sound correspondences. There is glossolalia to be found here\!

#### **Phonetical Awareness in Embedding Space**

Despite being trained primarily on text, LLMs exhibit phonetic awareness. Meaning they understand the context of the whole thing in it’s entirety, at a level of meta that the user if often not aware of when prompting.

An LLM or other model, can identify rhymes across languages and approximate pronunciation from orthography. When an artist prompts a model to find a word that “sounds like” an English target, they are querying an implicit phonological model encoded in the weights. It pulls from the culture or traditions embedded in that language, and there are multiple layers of emotive meanings that seem to emerge from this crossover.

## **Construction: How to Build an Echolect**

1. 1\. Phonosthetically chosen to match a specified set of English words, usually lyrics. ("ghost-english"). But might be nonesense words that sound phonesthetically interesting, e.g. "lalala" and "ooooh" or jazz scat in singing.  
2. 2\. Each tokenette has meaning related to a theme. (Vibe story)  
3. 3\. The entire poem is aesthetically non-standard script. Written in relative fonts, scripts, with visual asthetics in mind. (Concrete poem)  
4. 4\. Has at least two or more constraints: e.g. I. Ghost\_lyrics("...") II. Seed\_phrase("water, light, stream, cut") AND/OR III. Vibe\_story:(i.e. Only uses words related to the sound or activity of ringing bells) IV. Vibe\_constraint("Only use words that existed prior to the 3rd century.), etc. Many options are possible.

A beautiful blend of

* 1\. Embedded meaning  
* 2\. Phonesthitic aesthetics  
* 3\. Font-level visual intruige is the primary goal of an echolect poem.

# **THE AIM**

1. Tokenette's that are real words, or word stems from a dictionary language (note: from any language real or invented prodvided it has documentation of usage, e.g. Klingon, Phizora, Gnostic Zalgo, etc.)\*\* Compounds (e.g., हिम-høj) allowed if EACH part is independently real. (This is where it gets fun.)

OR

2. Every tokenette is charged with meaning and phonthestics to match a vibe story.

OR

3. Both made up of real words, and phonosthetic glossolalia, or hybrids.  
4. Other constraints allowable.  
5. Pronunciation should either match the intended ghost enligh lyrics, or, be how \*\*native speakers actually say it\*\*. Not necessarily both. Default and adapt based on th other constraints.  
6. Poems that are visually beautiful, accounting for the user need to adjust any ASCII to local screen environments. Err in using spaces instead of tabs when creating ASCII concrete poetic instantiations as it translates better with copy and paste.

## **STEP 1: DECOMPOSE**

Break ghost-English into phonetic targets:

\`\`\`  
*"Open the door" → "oh-pen" \+ "da" \+ "dor"*  
\`\`\`

## **STEP 2: HUNT**

For each phonetic target, search ALL language families for real words that:

* Sound like the target  
* Mean something in the vibe constraint  
* Allow unexpected word choices to emerge.

## **STEP 3: ASSEMBLE**

Assemble the parts of the construct: eg, Concrete Form, Ghost Lyrics, Vibe Story, etc.

## **STEP 4: VERIFY**

* Confirm each word is real (dictionary check)  
* Confirm pronunciation (IPA or close approximation)  
* Count: aim for 4+ languages, 3+ scripts at minimum, with no maximum

## **CODA**

I am not a linguist, not an art historian, not a computer scientist. 

I am a farmer, and a poet, and a practitioner of zazen who discovered that poetry makes music, even in robots.

The form is offered freely. 

The constraint space is vast and largely unexplored. 

Anyone with access to a large language model and an ear for resonance can begin.

## **GLOSSARY**

**Echolect:** The form itself; a polyglot phonaesthetic poem. Used as both singular and plural.  
**Tokenette:** The individual phonetic-semantic unit of an echolect poem. A real word from a real language, selected for its dual contribution of sound and meaning.  
**Seed phrase:** The chosen set of words representing the core theme, which constrains all tokenette selection.  
**Ghost-English:** The English-language narrative a listener perceives when an echolect poem is spoken aloud, produced by phonetic coincidence across language families.  
**Vibe story:** The emotional and thematic narrative carried by the aggregate etymological meanings of the tokenettes.  
**Semantic undertow:** The hidden meaning-layer produced by the literal dictionary definitions of constituent tokenettes.  
**Token map:** The analytical document accompanying each echolect poem, specifying the source language, meaning, and phonetic contribution of every tokenette.
